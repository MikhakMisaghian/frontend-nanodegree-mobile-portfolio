Things I did to optimize the website for project 4:
- Resized the pictures and used gulp to minify the images. It increased the Mobile Version Speed to 74/100 and Desktop version Speed to 86/100.


- Increased the PageSpeed by inlining it as script using google fonts page for Open Sans:

- Increased the pageSpeed by inlining CSS
