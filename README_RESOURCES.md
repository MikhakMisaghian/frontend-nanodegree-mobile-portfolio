Please use build folder to run the project. The build folder has the minified files also.

You can run my project here:
http://mikhakmisaghian.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/index.html

http://mikhakmisaghian.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/views/pizza.html

Or when using minified version use build folder and run it like below:
http://mikhakmisaghian.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/build/index.html

http://mikhakmisaghian.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/build/views/pizza.html

Things I did to optimize the website for project 4:
- Resized the pictures and used gulp to minify the images. It increased the Mobile Version Speed to 74/100 and Desktop version Speed to 86/100.


- Increased the PageSpeed by inlining it as script using google fonts page for Open Sans:
https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans

- Increased the pageSpeed by inlining CSS
- Increased the pageSpeed to 97/100 for Mobile and 98/100 for Desktop by minifying the html, css, and js files
